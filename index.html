                The ripple impact of Artificial Intelligence has spread from one industry to more than any other, including the Banking industry. The widespread adoption of AI in Banking & Financial Services is inevitable in order to keep up with competition, and increase
                their standing as an innovative company. Artificial intelligence has several applications in the banking industry. The innovative applications of artificial intelligence in the Banking industry will revolutionize the industry in the upcoming
                years. AML Pattern Detection is one such application. Anti-money laundering (AML) states to a set of processes, laws or protocols intended to stop the practice of spawning income through illegal actions. In most of the circumstances, the
                money launderers hide their activities through a sequence of stages that make it look like money that came from illegal or unethical sources are earned legitimately. Most of the major banks across the globe are shifting from rule based
                software systems to artificial intelligence based systems. These systems are more robust and intelligent to the anti-money laundering patterns. Over the years, these systems become more and more accurate and fast with the continuous innovations
                and progresses in the field of AI. <br /> Yet, a single or individual language for artificial intelligence has not been conceived till now. However, developers attain great results using existing tools. In many use cases,
                Java is identified as one of the best language for AI projects. Java works on artificial intelligence programming and it can be used to create machine learning solutions, neural networks, search algorithms, genetic programming and multi-robot
                systems. Java is object-oriented and scalable, which are also essential features for AI projects. Virtual machine technology improves Java portability, maintainability and transparency. Since artificial intelligence is tightly connected
                with algorithms, one more point in favor of Java in AI programming is the ability to code different types of algorithms. Java is a noble choice for large-scale projects. Since it has a built-in garbage collector it can automatically deletes
                inadequate data, facilitates visualization and incorporates Swing and Standard Widget Toolkit. These tools create appealing graphics and interfaces. The substantial Java community with its millions of members worldwide is a great reason
                for even a beginner to learn and create effective solutions easily. Though Java is multi-platform, it entails major adjustments of software and hardware to work on older platforms. As of now, Java is an immature AI language, and ongoing
                developments are being carried out. The use of AI for fraud prevention and other banking application is not a new concept. In fact, AI solutions using Java are there to enhance security across a number of business sectors, including retail
                and finance. It is evident that AI is impacting a large number of industries; Banking is an quick adopter of this trend. This trend is likely to grow exponentially in the future. Companies that embrace this trend are likely to be frontrunners
                in the coming years.

            Edge Computing is the process of preforming the computing operation at the edge of the Network, instead of performing on the core of the network. The latest technique in IoT is using an Edge-Computing. Edge Computing in IoT is used to provide a faster
            processing between the sensors, ensures the low latency and it reduce the bandwidth consumption, offline availability and local Machine-Learning inference. Edge Computing decentralize most of the process by pushing it to the edge of the network.
            It is a mesh network of microdata, that is IoT centres create and store the data locally before it is stored in data centre or cloud. Since the storage and processing power are decentralized, it ensures the working and operation of IoT device
            even in remote places. The edge computing in IoT works in such a way, where the data are collected from the surrounding and it is stored in the edge. The cloud will take a decision based on the data stored on the edge. Edge computing in IoT
            has four layers. In the first layer (Bottom) we have sensors, which will sense and gathers a data. Then those data will be stored in the Second layer which is Edge layer. In the Edge layer the devices and application work with those data.
            This were the edge computing steps in and reduce the complexity in working. The basic operation like machine learning are performed and basic decisions were taken based on the stored data in this layer. It reduces the network complexity and
            make sure that data is also available for real time process. It also ensures that the data are kept more secured as it doesn’t travel through various mediums. The third layer is the Fog computing layer. Fog computing also stores some data
            for various operations. The data stored in Fog can be distributed in a large scale. The fog computing can be used to perform complex process and real time analysis on the stored data. Also, the fog layer act as bridge between edge and cloud
            layer. In this layer the LAN (Local Area Network) is used in order to move the data to cloud for further process. The fourth layer (top layer) is the Cloud layer. In this layer the complex operation like data Analysis, deep learning and machine
            learning are performed. The example of Edge Computing in IoT is a Smart car. Usually the smart car will gather lot data from road, and those data will be stored in the Edge server in the car. This data can be used to find the status of the
            signal and nearby objects. When the car is autopilot mode, the speed of the car is automatically changed or maintained with the constant the speed with the help of data available the edge. The data stored in the fog can be used to track the
            battery percentage and it is also used to book a slot in the nearby charging station when the battery percentage goes less than the limit. The data stored in the cloud can be used for various purposes like tracking of the car, and to support
            the owner of the car by providing maintenance details.

            Vinimay - Leadership Series organized on 16<sup>th</sup> January 2020 at Kristu Jayanti College Autonomous emphasized on the topic Artificial Intelligence - A Boon or Bane. The objective of the series was to provide exposure on Artificial
            Intelligence(AI) for the budding managers. The series started with a holy choir song followed by lighting the lamp. Mr. Jibin Jose, student coordinator welcomed the gathering of 169 students that included MBA and MCA students, and Mr. Joshua
            George Thampy introduced the chief guest Dr. Gopichand Katragadda, Founder and CEO of Myelin Foundry to the audience. Dr. Aloysius Edward, Dean of Commerce and Management welcomed the guest with a bouquet of flowers.<br /> Dr. Gopichand commenced
            his interesting speech with various examples to bring out the tricky question - if AI is boon or bane to mankind. He also elaborated on the reasons behind him being rooted in augmented reality(AR) than into virtual reality(VR). He also briefed
            about VR in human life and it’s impact on thr users. Dr. Gopichand also narrated and reflected on some of the achievements that he made in his former company.<br /> The leadership session led by Dr. Gopichand Katragadda was motivating and
            helped all those who were present with a ambiguous understanding of AI. A questionnaire session was also held at the end. Ms. Namitha Mariam, student coordinator, proposed the vote of thanks to the guest. Dr. R Kumar, Head, Department of Computer
            Science(PG) gave a memento as a token of love and gratitude on behalf of the college to the chief guest Dr. Gopichand Katragadda. Ms. Swami Thirumeni, the MC of the session concluded with singing the college anthem. In the words of Jeffin
            Sebastian of I year MBA Sec B, “It was a motivational cum technical session. The personal and career life of the speaker was challenging and inspirational as well.” As reported by Prof. John Pradeep Kumar.
