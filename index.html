            Prominence of Information Technology in daily life has become inevitable than ever before. We are living in Technological era. We have seen the effects of the Agricultural era and industrial revolution. Now we are going through the Technological revolution.
            Education plays a major role in the pursuit of an important goal which is to be update and a leader in this world of technology. Online learning is the future of education. Advances in technology allow students to study entirely online while
            still socializing with classmates, watching lectures and participating in subject specific discussions. We are blessed as even in this pandemic we can impart knowledge and leverage the skills of students. Students not only attend lectures,
            quizzes but are also provided with journals, e-books, videos, live Q&A sessions and counselling such that one must continue their learning without any hurdles. Technology allows students to become much more engaged in constructing their own
            knowledge. Cognitive studies show that ability is the key to learning success. We need to get back to refining basics and spare no opportunities alone by grabbing all and expertise in our fields. The Coronavirus (COVID-19) is preventing students
            and staff, at many campuses, from meeting face-to-face. In the history of mankind, human beings always kept moving forward with the struggle of getting the best out of worst and so we will keep going and hope for the best. <br
            /> The Department of Computer Science (PG) Kristu Jayanti College aspires to enrich the new learning experience of students by escalating to new way of teaching and learning methods that amalgamate both formal and informal education. Online
            resources such as social networking sites, blogs, wikis, online apps, workshops have allowed people with common interests to meet, share ideas and collaborate in innovative ways. This culture of sharing and participation augmented by interactive
            learning and use of online resources has laid a successful foundation for the future of students. Apart from the delivery of curriculum through the novel teaching pedagogies, we engross them in social learning to augment and to sustain the
            technical skills of the students. <br/> ‘Technobytes’, the biannual newsletter of the department provides evidence for all the enriching activities held in the department. I wish all endeavours of the department a great success and appreciate
            the creativity of our students in showcasing the activities and achievements with a professional approach.

            The Department of Computer Science (PG), Kristu Jayanti College organized the 8th edition of the International Conference on Current Trends in Advanced Computing on 6th and 7th May 2020 through an Online Conference. The Department of Computer Science
            (PG) understood the unprecedented situation existing because of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and thought on its feet and moved the conference to the online platform. The original conference dates were March 19th and 20th and all necessary
            arrangements were made. The same speakers were retained and they were very happy to oblige and be part of this initiative by the Department of Computer Science (PG). The International Conference on Current Trends in Advanced Computing (ICCTAC)
            was set to provide an excellent forum for sharing knowledge and results in theory, methodology and applications of recent trends in Information Technology by internationally and nationally renowned experts in the field. The aim of the conference
            was to provide a platform to the researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to meet and share cutting-edge development in the field of Computer Science benefitting 196 participants that specifically included research scholars,
            faculty members and industry delegates. <br /> The session on 6th morning had Mr Amit Kumar Saha, Principal Engineer, Office of the Cloud CTO, Cisco Systems (India) Private Limited as the Chief Guest and Dr. Arduino Masaleno, Institute
            of Informatics & Computing Energy, Universiti Zenaga Nasional (UNITEN) Putrajaya, Malaysia as ‘Guest of Honour’. Dr A. Muruganantham, Conference Convener offered the welcome speech, Rev. Dr. Augustine George, Principal, Kristu Jayanti College,
            Bengaluru delivered the presidential address and Mr Amit Kumar Saha, delivered the inaugural address. Dr. Ardino Maseleno, Institute of Informatics & Computing Energy, Universiti Zenaga Nasional (UNITEN) Putrajaya, Malaysia was the resource
            person for Technical Session I. He discussed the need of Innovation in Research in a very interesting way. He discussed about Smart Grid in Malaysia and elaborated on some analysis of the Publications on Smart Grid Ontology. Mr. Biswajit Mishra,
            Cognitive Head, IpSoft, Bengaluru conducted the Technical Session II on the topic “Digital Twin and Blockchain”. He shared his insights on the Role of Human Digital Twin. He also discussed about the industrial advancements and the scenarios
            that would prevail due to the current pandemic (Covid-19). The second day of the conference on May 7th, 2020 started with a technical session on “Digital transformation and Live Enterprise”. The session was handled by Mr Victor Sundararaj,
            Head Engineering Academy, Infosys Limited, Bangalore. Mr Victor Sundararaj, addressed the participants on the latest technologies and the influence of it in the day to day life of human beings. The next session of the day was handled by Dr.
            Kunwar Singh, Assistant Professor, National Institute of Technology, Trichy, TamilNadu. The topic for the session was “Bitcoin Wallet”. A Bitcoin wallet is a software program where Bitcoins are stored. To be technically accurate, Bitcoins
            are not stored anywhere; there is a private key (secret number) for every Bitcoin address that is saved in the Bitcoin wallet of the person who owns the balance. Bitcoin wallets facilitate sending and receiving Bitcoins and give ownership
            of the Bitcoin balance to the user. The Bitcoin wallet comes in many forms; desktop, mobile, web, and hardware are the four main types of wallets . The session was very informative for all the participants. The last session for the second
            day was handled by Dr. Vishwas Lakkundi, Principal Architect, Smarten Spaces, Chair – IEEE Computer Society, Bangalore Chapter. He spoke on the topic Zero Trust Security Framework. <br /> The two day conference had many participants participating
